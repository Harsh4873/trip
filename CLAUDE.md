# Trip — working agreement

One of the split-repos projects. Full repo-specific rules live in AGENTS.md — read
it. These essentials always apply and are repeated here because Claude Code
auto-loads CLAUDE.md (AGENTS.md is not always auto-loaded):

## Ship every change end-to-end

A request to work on a feature, fix, or bug IS a request to ship it to production —
never stop at "coded" and never wait for a separate "commit / push / deploy" ask.
In the same session:

1. Implement and verify from source — run the repo's tests, typecheck, and build.
2. Commit as the currently logged-in GitHub user (verify with `gh api user`);
   never invent or switch identity.
3. Keep commit messages clean and human — never add AI co-author trailers,
   `Co-authored-by:` lines, or AI / Cursor / Codex / Claude taglines.
4. Push to `main`. Pushing runs `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, which builds
   and deploys to GitHub Pages — that push IS the deploy.
5. Confirm the deploy run with `gh run view`. Never open the deployed site or a
   live URL to verify — the owner checks production.

Do not force-push to `main`; leave unrelated dirty files out of the commit.

## No personal or sensitive information in the repo

These repositories are deployed publicly. Never write the owner's real name,
personal email, home location, or other personal or sensitive details into
committed files (source, docs, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) or commit messages. Refer to
"the owner" generically. The GitHub commit identity is the only owner reference
that belongs in the repo.

## Bypass permissions is pre-authorized

This repo runs in bypass-permissions mode with standing approval via
`.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored). Any split-repos repo missing it may be
set up the same way — `{ "permissions": { "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions" } }` — without asking.
